# PaperRevision
This repo provides a demonstration on how to prepare a paper revision in `LaTeX` in VScode.

*Notes*
The key file in this repo is the `.vscode/task.json` which implements a task to generate `diff.tex` automatically given an `old.tex` and `new.tex`.
Folder `build` contains auxilliary files generated by LaTeX and may not take place in your machine(I specify this location on purpose in the setting of `TexLab` extension).

```
old.tex # your initial manuscript
new.tex # your revised manuscript
diff.tex # automatically generated by latexdiff
```
